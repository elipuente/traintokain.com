## Train to Kain Fitness Competition

Train to Kain allows users to compete in a fitness competition by entering their daily workouts. The user will be given a score based on the point per minute (ppm) value associated with their workout type (found in [`data/workoutTypes.js`](https://github.com/elipuente/traintokain.com/blob/main/data/workoutTypes.js)).

Anyone can view the current standings and previously entered user workouts without needing to sign in.
